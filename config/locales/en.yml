# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

<b>How to order?</b><br>
All you need to do is to find a product you want, open it and once you get its details and features you decide to purchase, click Add to cart. Once you put the item in your cart, click on the shopping cart icon in the top right corner, and you will open a list of open items you choose. All you need to do is to press the next step. In case you do not have a registered account, simply fill out the form with your information and click Pay with card. Secure payment is made possible with the help of technology Stripe (https://stripe.com/). However, we recommend that you register before purchasing, because in that case we will keep your information so you do not have to enter each time. Also, you have the right to see your previous purchases.<br><br><b>How to register?</b><br>
